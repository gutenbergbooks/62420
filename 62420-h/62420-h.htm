RELIGIOUS TRACT SOCIETY, INSTITUTED 1799.</span><br />
<span class="GutSmall">56, PATERNOSTER ROW, AND 65, ST.
PAUL&rsquo;S CHURCHYARD.</span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Thinks</span> I to myself the other
sabbath afternoon, as I sat alone with my Bible before
me&mdash;thinks I to myself, that was a comforting text in
God&rsquo;s holy word that our minister preached from this
morning; &ldquo;All things work together for good to them that
love God:&rdquo; and a capital sermon it was, too, that he gave
us; for though it cut me to the heart on account of my sins, it
brought the tears into my eyes, on account of God&rsquo;s mercy
and grace.</p>
<p>Well, I read the chapter that the text was taken from all to
myself; for my Nancy was gone to public worship, and I was left
to take care of the house, and our little Mary, and the young one
in the cradle.&nbsp; The house was clean and tidy, and everything
was quiet, and I felt happy like.&nbsp; Trust me for having as
many cares as my neighbours; a poor man ought not to expect to be
without them, nor, for the matter of that, a rich man neither:
but I felt happy, and though I said nothing, my heart thanked
God.</p>
<p>Thinks I to myself, we are bad enough as it is; ay, the very
best of us; but if places of worship were to be shut up, and we
had no ministers to preach to us, and had no Bibles to read, we
should be a deal worse than we are: and this set me a thinking
about the blessing of the sabbath day, and the comfort of prayer,
and the peace of mind there is in thinking of the salvation of
Christ, and the promises of God.&nbsp; Not that I can always get
the comfort from them as I could wish, for I am a poor ignorant
creature, and the turn of a straw is enough, at times, to turn my
thoughts from good things to bad.&nbsp; But I felt, as I said,
happy like in the quietness that a God fearing man enjoys on the
sabbath day, and in the peace of that religion in which my dear
father and mother before me had lived and died; and I was
determined, with God&rsquo;s help, to stick to it, while I had
any breath in my body.&nbsp; Thinks I, there is many of us that
have sadly stood in our own light, in <a name="page2"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 2</span>neglecting the sabbath and holy
things.&nbsp; What fools we are to cheat ourselves as we
do!&nbsp; When we run after our follies, the jack o&rsquo;
lanterns that dance before us, and lead us astray, no wonder that
we get into the mire; &ldquo;but they that wait upon the Lord
shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as
eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk,
and not faint,&rdquo; Isaiah xl. 31.</p>
<p>As I sat musing in this way over my Bible, the door-way was
darkened a little, all on a sudden; so I lifted up my head, and
there I saw Tom Fletcher with a lot of books in his hand.</p>
<p>Tom was once a shopmate of mine; and, though I never took him
to be a very wise man, nor over bright in his upper story, yet,
for all that, he was better than many.&nbsp; He had brought his
books on purpose to talk to me about them.&nbsp; In a minute or
two we were in the thick of them.</p>
<p>Says he, &ldquo;I have not seen you for some time; and since
you and I met, I have joined the Socialists.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Joined who?&rdquo; says I.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; says
he, &ldquo;the Socialists;&rdquo; and with that he told me all
about it.&nbsp; By his account it seemed that the world had been
going round the wrong way ever since it was made, but the
Socialists were going to put matters to rights again.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Just shut up your Bible,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;and I will
show you my books.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now I had heard of the Socialists before, and as I had not the
best opinion of them, I thought my Bible quite as good, and a
pretty deal better than their books.&nbsp; &ldquo;Tom,&rdquo;
says I, &ldquo;a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.&nbsp;
If I shut my Bible, you are not likely to open as good a book, I
have a notion; so we had better let well alone.&rdquo;&nbsp; But
Tom was very pressing; and so, putting his books on the table, he
began to tell me, that the Socialists had no object in the world
but the good of mankind; that everything had been for ages, and
now was, all sixes and sevens; and that matters were not likely
to be mended, till, burning our Bibles, and putting aside
religion, and all our other fanciful notions, we became
Socialists.</p>
<p>Thinks I to myself, Great cry and little wool, Tom; but as I
had never looked into any of the books of the Socialists, I
picked up the one that lay at the top, and turned over a few
pages, dipping here and there.</p>
<p>I suppose the colour came into my cheeks; for Tom looked hard
at me.&nbsp; &ldquo;Tom,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;if so be that I
haven&rsquo;t been <a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
3</span>walking on my head instead of my heels all the days of my
life, and if I know black from white, why then this book of yours
is an indecent and abominable book, that I should be ashamed to
put into any body&rsquo;s hand.&nbsp; Is it possible that Tom
Fletcher, my old shopmate, can hold&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; says Tom, looking as sharp as a hawk at the
book in my hand, &ldquo;oh,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t
mean you to see that!&nbsp; I thought I had put that number a one
side.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t hold exactly with it.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t hold exactly with it!&rdquo; says I;
&ldquo;why it&rsquo;s no more fit to be touched than a tarred
stick.&nbsp; If the rest of your books are like it, a precious
lot they must be altogether.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom looked a little queerish, as if he was ashamed of the book
and of himself too.&nbsp; Thinks I to myself, Now&rsquo;s my time
to have a rap at him; for though I feel kindly to him, yet as he
seems to want it, a rap on the knuckles mayhap will do him
good.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so, Tom,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;this is one of the
books of the Socialists, is it?&nbsp; One of the books that you
want to recommend to me?&nbsp; Now tell me if you really think in
your heart and conscience that that book is fit to be read by
anybody?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom looked first one way, then another; he was all
abroad.&nbsp; At last, says he, &ldquo;I meant to burn that
book.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Glad to hear it,&rdquo; says I; so
taking up the book, with his consent, I poked it between the bars
of the grate, and a rare blaze it made, flaring half way up to
the mantel piece, giving more light to the world than it had ever
done before, or ever would have done in any other way.</p>
<p>Says I to Tom, when the filthy book was burned, says I,
&ldquo;Tom, when a man goes to market to buy a cheese, and the
cheesemonger pushes in his borer that he may taste it, if he
doesn&rsquo;t like the bit that he bores out, it sets him against
the whole cheese; for he naturally expects that one is like the
other.&nbsp; Now it is just the same with your books: birds of a
feather, you know, flock together; and as one of them has turned
out to be a black crow, I hardly expect to find the rest of
&rsquo;em to be white pigeons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well, I took up all his books, one after another: some things
in them I did understand and some I did&rsquo;nt; for there was
so much about <i>impressions</i>, and <i>principles</i>, and
<i>institutions</i>, and <i>propensities</i> and
<i>organizations</i> that it flustered me.&nbsp; It was clear
that a longer head than mine had been <a name="page4"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 4</span>concerned in getting &rsquo;em up; so
all that I could do was to try to get at some of the marrow of
them here and there.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not over clever at book learning, but still I had
gumption enough to make out a few points that settled my opinion
about Socialism.&nbsp; I saw, or thought I saw, that the god of
the Socialists was only a &ldquo;Cause of all existences;&rdquo;
that he never troubled his head about us, and that we ought never
to trouble our heads about him.&nbsp; That, in fact, there was no
such God, in the Socialists&rsquo; opinion, as the gracious
Almighty Being whom Christians worship.</p>
<p>I saw, too, that Socialists believed the Bible to be a lie,
trumped up to keep silly people in bondage: that marriage was
considered &ldquo;the greatest crime against nature,&rdquo; that
ought to be done away with; that theft, adultery, blasphemy, and
murder were no crimes, for man was &ldquo;not a responsible
being;&rdquo; he was &ldquo;neither to be blamed or praised,
rewarded or punished for either his thoughts, feelings, or
actions;&rdquo; that death was &ldquo;simply a change of one
organization for another;&rdquo; and that the Christian notions
of hell, heaven, and hereafter were all a bag full of
moonshine.</p>
<p>Now it grieved me that an old shopmate of mine should have
tumbled into such a bog hole as Socialism; but thinks I, mayhap,
after all, he has only been led out of the way by sharper fellows
than himself, and doesn&rsquo;t above half believe the juggling
claptraps that are printed in his books; so I said to him,
&ldquo;Tom, look at me and answer me this question, Do you
believe that there is a God?&rdquo;&nbsp; Tom blinked, and
shuffled, and stammered, and opened one of the books and read a
bit about &ldquo;nature,&rdquo; and a &ldquo;first cause,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;a general principle,&rdquo; and a &ldquo;supreme
power,&rdquo; and &ldquo;an external cause of all
existence,&rdquo; and an &ldquo;all pervading cause of motion and
change;&rdquo; but I stopped him at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tom,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;you may spare yourself the
trouble of running over that long rigmarole; for I&rsquo;m not to
have dust flung in my eyes in that way.&nbsp; I do not want to
know what <i>your book says</i>, but what <i>you believe</i>; so
answer my question.&nbsp; A handful of good grain is better than
a bushel of chaff, and a yes or a no can be understood by any
body.&nbsp; Do you believe that there is a gracious and merciful
God, that you are bound to fear and to love with all your heart,
with all your mind, with all your soul, and with all your
strength, to worship him, to give him thanks, to put your whole
trust in him, to call upon him, to honour his holy <a
name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>name and his
word, and to serve him truly all the days of your
life?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I saw that whether Tom said yes or no, it was all one, for he
didn&rsquo;t know which to say.&nbsp; It suited him better to
read to me out of his books than it did to answer my questions;
but I asked him another question.&nbsp; &ldquo;Tom,&rdquo; says
I, &ldquo;do you really believe that the Bible is a lie?&nbsp;
You don&rsquo;t doubt the history of England, the history of
Rome, and the history of Greece, and these have never been kept
with half the care, nor gone through a tenth part of the sifting
that the Bible has.&nbsp; Do you really believe that the Bible is
a lie?&rdquo;&nbsp; Tom had not the boldness to say that he did;
and I felt sure in my heart that he did not think it was.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Tom,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;are you so far gone as to think
that marriage is a foolish and wicked institution?&nbsp; I
thought your sister was going to be married; is it all off, then,
or is she to disgrace you and her family?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This question twisted Tom as much as the last, and I saw that
I was about as likely to get a badger out of his hole, as to get
an answer from him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;Tom,
I&rsquo;ll say nothing about your sister, if its disagreeable,
but ask you another question instead.&nbsp; Have you so little
uprightness left in your deceived heart as to suppose that theft,
adultery, blasphemy, and murder are no reproach to a man; and
that any one may set up the trade of a robber on the highway, and
justify himself by saying that he cannot help it, for &lsquo;his
character is formed for him by circumstances?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom was not at all staunch; he did not stick up like one that
believes and has confidence in what he says.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Tom,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;t&rsquo;other day a loaded cart
was standing in the road half way up Gravelly Hill, with the
wheels scotched, when a mischievous lad knocked the stones from
under the wheels, and away went the loaded cart, over his foot,
rattling down the hill, clearing every thing before it.&nbsp; The
young urchin was half frightened out of his wits; he set the cart
off easily enough, but not the whole neighbourhood could stop
it.&nbsp; Now I take it, Tom, that the young rapscallion played
just the same game as the Socialists are playing, with this
difference, that the wheel of the cart only went over his toes,
whereas the mischief that the Socialists are setting on foot will
in the long run, go over their own necks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom kept fumbling at his books, not knowing what to be
at.&nbsp; He wanted somebody to back him.&nbsp; He believed his
<a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>books just
as much, and no more, than he would have believed any other tale
of a tub, told him by a cleverer fellow than himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tom,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;when a man once turns his
back upon God, there is no folly and no sin that he may not be
led to commit.&nbsp; You have gone a long way, and I&rsquo;m
sorry for it; but I hardly think you are gone as far as your
famous books will take you.&nbsp; Speak up now like a man, and
tell me, have you been fooled into the belief that there is no
hereafter?&mdash;no hell, and no heaven?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this Tom looked like any thing but a conjurer.&nbsp; At
length he said that if I would read more of his books I should
understand them better than I did.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Read your books, Tom!&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;I should
just as soon think of taking a dose of arsenic.&nbsp; A pretty
deal rather had I walk barefoot through Boxley Bog, and many a
better man than me has been stuck fast there,&mdash;a pretty deal
rather had I do that, than turn Socialist.&nbsp; If I wanted to
be worse than I am, to deprive myself of all hope, and to plunge
myself into despair, I couldn&rsquo;t do a better thing than read
your trumpery; but as it is, I will have nothing to do with
it.&nbsp; Tom,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;you are no fool in driving a
bargain: you would not be persuaded to exchange a quartern loaf
for a handful of sawdust.&nbsp; Now Socialism takes away from a
Christian man the Bible that comforts him, the sabbath that is
his delight, the God that he worships, the Saviour that died for
him, and the heaven that he hopes for: tell me, then, Tom, what
does it give him in return?&rdquo;</p>
<p>If ever poor fellow was confounded, it was Tom Fletcher.&nbsp;
Had he been sitting on a furze bush, he could hardly have been
more fidgetty.&nbsp; He got out a few words, but they were very
scarce and a long way apart; and as he could&rsquo;nt well put
&rsquo;em together, no wonder that I can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Well, I had only been firing at him, as it were, a pop, now
and then, from a long way off, but now I was determined to bear
upon him all at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t for me, Tom,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;that
am not what I ought to be by a great deal&mdash;it isn&rsquo;t
for me, knowing as I do a little of the wickedness of my own
heart, to deal out fire and brimstone against my fellow sinners,
and to pretend that I am white as snow and they as black as soot;
but for all that, Tom, we may be too tender with one
another.&nbsp; If I see an adder lying in a thoroughfare where he
may sting the <a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span>passer by, I&rsquo;m bound to disable him; and if I see a
mad dog, foaming at the mouth, running through the crowded
street, I&rsquo;m bound, if I can, to kill him.&nbsp; Now the
adder and the mad dog are not likely to do half the mischief that
your books are, and therefore I hold up both my hands, and cry
out aloud against them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look you,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;Tom, there lies the
Bible.&nbsp; It condemns every thing that is evil, even every
sinful thought, and upholds every thing that is good.&nbsp; It
teaches me to fear God, and to love my neighbour; and tells me,
sinner as I am, that there is mercy for me through Jesus Christ
who died for sinners.&nbsp; It gives me comfort in life, it
promises me support in death, and holds up before me the bright
prospect of a happy eternity; and it has done this for thousands
who have left this world in peace, and who are now, as I believe,
in a world of glory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there, Tom, be your wretched books, which tell me,
that is, if I at all understand them, that there is no God; that
the Bible is a lie; that marriage is a foolish institution; that
men ought to live just as they think proper; that theft,
adultery, blasphemy and murder are no crimes; that there is
neither hell nor heaven; and that it is idle to dream of a
hereafter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I know my own heart, Tom, or even any part of it, I
wouldn&rsquo;t knowingly say a cruel thing of a butcher&rsquo;s
dog; but this I will say, that I should as soon expect to be
taught manners by a Hottentot, cleanliness by a sweep, honesty by
a highwayman, and godliness by a heathen, as to be made either
wiser, better, holier, or happier by having any thing to do with
Socialism.&nbsp; But what says that book?&nbsp; &lsquo;The grace
of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men, teaching
us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live
soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world; looking
for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great
God and our Saviour Jesus Christ; who gave himself for us, that
he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a
peculiar people, zealous of good works,&rsquo; Titus ii.
11&ndash;14.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Never did a poor fellow caught in the fact of robbing a
hen-roost, slink away in a more humble, chopfallen spirit than
poor Tom Fletcher did.&nbsp; Whether he will ever bring me
another batch of his Socialism books or not, I can&rsquo;t tell;
but if he does, the first question that I shall ask him will be
<a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>this, What
have you got to offer me in exchange for the consolations of my
Bible, the comfort of prayer, the peace of the sabbath, the
goodness of God, the mercy of the Redeemer, and the never-ending
joys of heaven?&nbsp; And never till he gives me something like a
reasonable answer will I ever open another of his books on
Socialism.</p>

United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as

  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
